# UpperWhiteData
The headwater region of the White River is the leading contributor of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico across the entire Mississippi River Basin. Recent studies from Ball State University (BSU) and conservation partners, e.g., TNC, have determined that there is inadequate flow data from the region, making it difficult to calibrate hydrological models and support detailed conservation practices. As a result, BSU and TNC contracted with the Ecosystems Connections Institute (ECI), and installed gauging stations at the Prairie Creek Reservoir and immediately downstream. Instrumentation was conducted in August - September 2021 by ECI, with permission from the Indiana American Water. Hourly data of water level, water temperature, discharge, and turbidity is monitored since 2021. The first set of data has been permanently archived in Hydroshare. As the data is continuously archived, this github site serves as a repository that will be irregularly updated.
